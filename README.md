# Customer_Segmentation

Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using clustering algorithms. The goal is to group customers based on behavioral attributes such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.
Dataset
The Mall Customer Segmentation dataset contains information about customers, such as age, gender, income, and spending score. This dataset is commonly used to understand customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and normalize features.
- Feature Selection: Choose relevant features for clustering (e.g., Annual Income, Spending Score).
- RFM Analysis (optional): Compute Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for enhanced segmentation.
- Clustering: Apply K-Means to group customers into distinct clusters.
- Visualization: Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize customer clusters.
Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn and Matplotlib
Learning Outcomes
- Learn to preprocess and analyze customer demographic and behavioral data.
- Understand and apply clustering algorithms such as K-Means.
- Visualize customer segments to derive actionable insights.
- Interpret cluster characteristics to inform business decisions.
